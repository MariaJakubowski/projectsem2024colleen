# EEG Project Seminar Documents and Scripts

## Course Description 
Since the 1960s electroencephalography (EEG) has been used in the fields of psychology and cognitive neuroscience to study neural activity in humans. To this day, EEG remains one of the most popular methods in cognitive neuroscience research. Yet, its proper use can be quite intricate.
In this course, you will learn how to use EEG in the context of a project in cognitive neuroscience. Beyond theoretical proficiency, you will gain hands-on experience collecting, analyzing and interpreting EEG data using EEGLAB (MATLAB). Students will also write and submit a short thesis-like report on the project at the end of the term.
 
Notes:
* Coding experience is not required. Previous experience with EEG is not required.
* This course will be given in English.
 
#### Requirements:
All students should have and come to class with their own laptop which should have enough free space to allow for the download use of MATLAB (Minimum: 8GB, Recommended: 16GB).
 

#### Learning objectives:
* Theoretical Insights: Gain a solid theoretical foundation of how to design EEG studies and how to interpret ERP (event-related potential) data.
* Hands-On Experience: Learn how to and practice collecting your own EEG data. You will also learn how to use EEGLAB (MATLAB) to visualize and analyze ERPs. Finally, you will learn how to and write your own paper reporting the results of your EEG study.
 
 
#### Didactic concept:
Each class will include a lecture as well as hands on practice. Homework will be assigned to complement the material and concepts discussed in class.
In the second half of the course, students will collect and work with their own EEG data.

#### Literature:
Weekly readings (provided by the instructor) will be communicated in the first session of the course. All assigned readings/articles will be in English.
You can find the readings in the readings folder.
