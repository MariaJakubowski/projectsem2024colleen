## Scripts 

In this folder you will find 2 scripts which will guide you in 1) pre-processing your EEG data and 2) generating grand average ERPs and topographies. 
Note that, in each section of these scripts, some critical information is missing. You will learn in class/in your small teams what this information is and how to ensure the script runs as it should. 

While there are comments at the start of each section of code, these scripts are void of line by line comments. You should add this to your scripts as needed to ensure you can use/modify them in the future when you have your own datasets.
